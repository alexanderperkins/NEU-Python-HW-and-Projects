In this example we are going to calculate the salary of a camera salesperson. 
Their basic salary is 1500, for every camera they will sell they will get 200 and 
the commission on the monthâ€™s sale is 2%. The input will be number of cameras sold 
and total price of the cameras.

For full credit, your solution must have all of the following functions:

    A function welcome that takes no parameters and returns no values. 
    The function will print a friendly welcome message to the user.
    A function get_cameras_sold that takes no parameters, prompts the user for
     the number of cameras sold, and returns the user's input as an integer.
    A function get_camera_price that takes no parameters, prompts the user for
     the price of each camera, and returns the user's input as a float.
    A function calculate_total_pay that takes two parameters: the number of
     cameras sold and the price per camera. The function will calculate the
      total pay as described above and return that value.
    A function display_total that will take as input the total and print it for
     the user in a nicely formatted message.
    A main function that will call the functions above appropriately.
