Replace the # YOUR CODE HERE markers below with
code that will calculate the correct values for
difference, product, and average. Complete the
print statements to output correctly formatted  
results.

Note: the code below is not syntactically correct and will not run until
you replace the # YOUR CODE HERE with the correct solution.
